<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>I don’t remember any of this, it’s what
I’ve been told. On June 10, 2013, Joan came home about <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_562020126" tabindex="0">
<span class="aQJ">11:30 am</span></span>
from her <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_562020127" tabindex="0"> <span class="aQJ">Monday</span></span>
morning hike to find me lying on my back on the back patio with my feet
on the steps leading into the house. I had been running on the
treadmill but collapsed when I started into the house. I was gasping
for breath but unresponsive, and my eyes were open staring into the hot
sun. The back of my head was bleeding where I had hit the concrete. She
immediately started CPR and called 911 and after talking to the man on
duty she unlocked the front door so they could get inside. When the
firemen got here they took over the CPR and the&nbsp; paramedics
hooked me up to the defibrillator machine, and gave me an injection
of&nbsp; epinephrine. After three shocks, and three injections of
medication they loaded me onto a stretcher and into the ambulance and
took me to the ER at the closest hospital. </b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
was in a medically induced coma for 72 hours or 3&nbsp; days. The
cardiologist&nbsp; told Joan I had 3 severely clogged coronary
arteries. They opened my 2 main clogged artery with balloon
angioplasty. The doctor explained the risks of hypothermia and Joan had
to sign for me to have it. They started lowering my body temperature
but I couldn’t handle it so after 12 hours they slowly brought my body
back to its normal temperature They told Joan I had a 50-50 chance of
surviving<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></b><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>&nbsp;After 72
hours I regained consciousness and the nurse called Joan at <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_562020128" tabindex="0">
<span class="aQJ">6 am</span></span>
to come to hospital. I asked her several times as best I could being
intubated "what happened?" and finally I understood and I was able to
sign the release for quadruple heart bypass surgery which happened <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_562020129" tabindex="0">
<span class="aQJ">in 2 days</span></span>.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
spent over 2 weeks in the hospital (in the cardiac unit, and then on
the rehab floor) and was released to go home where I was seen by a
visiting nurse. I was on the rehab unit for problems with my balance
and gait. After a week at home I had to return because of breathing
problems. It seemed to be pneumonia &amp; both leg and pulmonary
embolisms were found<br>
&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They
drained 2 liters of bloody fluid from the cavity in my back and then I
could breath again. After a bag of IV antibiotics and many pills I was
able to go home again after 4 days. </b> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My next ordeal was a granuloma on my vocal cords that was preventing me
from speaking. It was caused by all the tubes that were put in my
throat that kept me alive. The medication did not work and finally a
huge growth had to be removed by the ENT doctor with Scappel knife
scrapping surgery. <br>
&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After about a week of healing from all this operation my left lower
forearm started to be painful and swell and I spent Labor Day in the
emergency room getting more bags of IV antibiotics for the infection
from the anesthesia IV I got for the granuloma removal.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After 6 weeks in cardio rehab on treadmills and stationary bikes I
really started to recover and to this date nothing more has happened. I
am working on getting my medical back so I can fly again. Joan is
starting to have PTSD from thinking I was going to die. That is a hard
thing to get over. I really think that Joan giving me CPR' being vegan
and exercising daily helped save my
life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></font> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: black; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;This Diet is Extremely hard for people</span></em><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: black;"><br>
</span><em><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: black; font-style: normal;">Of all
the people I've tried to influence to go the route of this diet only my sister,
daughter, and wife could manage to stay on it. Unless you have a
major health crisis and a support group that will help you when you weaken and
you will. There are many contributing factors that will try to steer you
astray. Since others have tried and failed or not even tried at all they don't
want you to succeed either. You will miss the comraderie and enjoyment of eating
out with your friends when they want to go to a restaurant that you know you
can't go to. Of course you can always eat before you go and just get a drink or order a
side of something. Anyway this diet is hard to stay on for almost all of us.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></em><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: black;"><br>
<em><span style="font-style: normal;">People will ask you, "Where do you get your protein?
Are you sure you know what you are doing? Show me the studies that this diet
works, The brain needs fat &amp; oil. You don't look good when you are so thin."
Everyone needs a diet tailored for themselves, and&nbsp; there are many more - it's endless
so I have to do my own thing and stick with it.</span></em></span> <o:p></o:p></p>

<ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><em style="font-style: normal;"><font color="#000000"><big>This
is the Diet I am on now&nbsp;Whole Food Plant Based, SOS (salt,oil
sugar) free. I should say that I strive for being SOS Free because being a vegan is no problem but
staying off the salt, oil and sugar is. Every time I go to a restaurant
I get salt, &amp; oil I try to keep it to a minimum by telling them no
oil but the waiters give you a funny look and say ok (they lie) but I
guess they do the best they can? I mostly eat at home except for
occasionally. There 3 restaurants where I can eat: Subway, Sharkeys,
Chipotle. That way I can stay relatively oil free. Caffeine is a big
problem for me. If I stay off of it my blood pressure is fine but when
I drink ice tea that I love my blood pressure shoots through the
roof. Caffeine also effects me in lots of other ways including my vision&nbsp;so
it is very important to me to stay off it.</big></font></em></big></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><em style="font-style: normal;"><font color="#000000"><big>Exercise</big></font></em></big></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><em style="font-style: normal;"><font color="#000000"><big>Right
now I am babying a tweeked knee back to life and it is coming along
great. I try to workout 7 days a week about an hour a day maybe a
little more. Today I ran/walked 20 minutes on my treadmill and did my
weight lifting and stretching routine. I will also walk in the
neighborhood for 30 minutes. Tomorrow I will ride my street bike about
11.5 miles and walk in the afternoon. If I have time I like to take one
longer bike ride of 22 miles. or walk a mountian path 3 to 4 miles,
depending on how I feel and what the weather is like. I &nbsp;rotate
what I do to every other day for instance Bike, walk, Mountain
nature walk,&nbsp;Neighborhood walk, and Treadmill when weather calls
for it.</big></font></em></big></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><em style="font-style: normal;"><font color="#000000"><br>

and I are both vegan. (but junk food vegan) I have been a vegan for
over 20 years although I have eaten fish occasionally. I do this
because of health concerns with a history of early deaths from heart
disease in my family. I want to change that for myself. Joan decided in
2012 to try a 21 day kick-start program offered by the Physician's
Committee for Responsible Medicine website</font></em> <a href="http://www.pcrm.org/">http://www.pcrm.org/</a><em style="font-style: normal;"><font color="#000000">.
It has menus and recipes and we both liked it and felt better so after
the 21 days we continued the Vegan meals. It's been a year now and we
both have improved lab results at our physicals. since the cardiac
event Don's (vegan-Whole food plant based no oil) diet is much more
strict now (no oil very little salt) his labs are much improved.</font></em></big></big></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise</strong> - I like
to exercise every day. I used to run on the street but now I choose the
treadmill. I run every other day. I change my routine often but average
4 miles Every other day.I also like to ride my Bicycle. Typically I
ride about 13 miles every other day. I also go for a walk with Joan
when I can.When I watch TV at night During the commercials I like to do
push ups 3 sets of 30. do curls with 22 lbs 170,185, 200 reps. Sit ups
3 sets of 50 </li>
<li><strong>Computers</strong> - I like
computers. I like fixing things when I don't have to. I like learning
new things that I can do with computers. Joan says that I spent way too
much time on them and I do at times. I built a computer for my airplane
hanger and run it off of an inverter powered by batteries, wind powered
alternator and Solar panels&nbsp;
